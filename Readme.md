This project encompasses diverse mini-projects, each tackling various classical machine learning algorithms.

- Clustering Mini Project: Involves applying K Means and Hierarchical clustering to the Fashion-MNIST dataset. It also includes image compression using K Means Clustering.
- Decision Tree Mini Project: Centers on classifying the authenticity of banknotes based on provided features.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Mini Project: Focuses on classifying the location of wifi routers using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm.
- KNN Mini Project: Aims to predict the popularity of given tweets through K-Nearest Neighbors analysis.
- Linear Regression Mini Project: Implements linear regression from scratch for a given dataset.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Mini Project: Concentrates on predicting whether a given email is spam or not using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
- PCA Mini Project: Involves creating a face recognition system through Principal Component Analysis.
- SVM Mini Project: Implementing Support Vector Machine algorithm from scratch and using it on a toy data set. 
More details about each mini project can be found in the notebook file.
